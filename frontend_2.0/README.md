## Triphelper
# CS411 Spring 2022 Lab Section A5 Group 4 Triphelper

# Project Description:
Triphelper helps users plan trips! Users will be able to enter a location and the app will return restaurants and hotels nearby to make planning vacations faster. These trips will be saved to their account and will be accessable again at a later time.

We used the Google Maps API, Yelp Fusion API, ExchangeRate, and Walk Score. User information is saved on MongoDB, the Frontend was created using React and the backend was created using Flask.
